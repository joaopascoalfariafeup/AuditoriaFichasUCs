## Resultados de aprendizagem e competências
<p>People often think about &#8220;marketing&#8221; strictly as advertising &#8212; a highly visible activity by which organizations try to persuade customers to buy products and services. However, marketing is much more than advertising alone; even the most skilful marketer cannot make customers buy things that they don't want. In this course students will acquire skills and competencies to make and defend marketing decisions in the context of real-world problem situations with incomplete information (case studies and simulations) and make cross-functional connections between marketing and other business areas. The skills acquired will be useful regardless of the industry.</p>
<p data-start="350" data-end="652">Upon completion of <strong data-start="369" data-end="404">Marketing: A Strategic Approach</strong>, students will have acquired the competencies to design, communicate, and implement marketing strategies within a broader strategic management framework. The focus will be on rigorous analysis, ethical reasoning, and sustainable decision-making.</p>
<p data-start="654" data-end="757">We will emphasise four core competencies, each articulated through traits and rubrics of performance:</p>
